# Consult

Consult is an LLM-powered tool to automate the processing of public consultations.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Incubation Project: This project is an incubation project; as such, we don't recommend using this for critical use cases yet. We are currently in a research stage, trialling the tool for case studies across the Civil Service. If you are a civil servant and wish to take part in our research stage, please contact us at i-dot-ai-enquiries@cabinetoffice.gov.uk.


This repository is a work in progress, containing a Django app to visualise and explore consultation data and LLM-generated themes.

For our core AI-pipeline used for topic modelling to classify consultation responses into themes, please see our [themefinder](https://pypi.org/project/themefinder/) Python package on PyPi.


## Setting up the application

### External dependencies

- PostgreSQL (`brew install postgresql`)
- redis (`brew install redis`)
- GraphViz (`brew install graphviz`), for generating diagrams
- precommit (`brew install pre-commit`)

Installation instructions assume using a Mac with Homebrew.

### Clone the repo

```
git clone git@github.com:i-dot-ai/consult.git
```

In the new repo install pre-commit:
```
cd consult
```
```
pre-commit install
```
Pre-commit identifies some potential secrets on commit (but will not catch all potential sensitive information).

### Environment variables

Populate `.env` by copying `.env.example` and filling in required values.


### Install packages

Ensure you have `python 3.12.3`, `poetry` and `npm` installed. Then run `poetry install`, and `npm install`.

### Database setup

```
brew services start postgresql
```
This will run the postgresql locally.

```
make dev_environment
```

This will set up dev and test databases with dummy data. See the definition of that make task for the various steps.

It will also set up the admin account to dev environment.

You will have an staff user (i.e. one that can access the admin) created with the username `email@example.com` and the password `admin`.


Confirm everything is working with

```
make check_db
```

(You can see all the available `make` commands by running bare `make` or `make help`).

### Run the application

Make sure redis is running:
```
brew services start redis
```

The database should also be running as described above.

Then run:
```
make serve
```

Go to `http://localhost:8000` in the browser.

### Run the tests

```
make test
```

## The database

### Importing synthetic data
Will create a consultation with 9 questions in both free-text and multiple
choice formats and around 300 answers for each.

```
poetry run python manage.py import_synthetic_data
```
Or go to `/support/consultations/` and import a synthetic consultation from there.

### Generating dummy data
Only run this in development. Will create a consultation with 100 complete
responses in a variety of question formats. This runs as part of `make
dev_environment`, but you can run it more than once.

```
make dummy_data
```

Or go to `/support/consultations/` and generate a dummy consultation from there.

### Database migrations and schema diagram

If you use the `make migrate` command to run migrations, the diagram below will
be regenerated automatically. If you need to generate it outside that process,
you can run `manage.py generate_erd`. (You will need `graphviz` installed: see
[`pydot` docs](https://pypi.org/project/pydot/)).

## Login

### Magic links

You can sign into the application using a magic link, requested via `/sign-in/`. 
You need to have a user set-up first - add new users in `/support/users/` 
(only be done by `staff` members).

When running locally, you can create your first admin user using `make dev_admin_user`, 
on dev/pre-prod/prod ask one of the existing members of the team.

For convenience, in local dev environments the value of the magic link will be
logged along with the rest of the server logs.


### The frontend

#### CSS

We depend on `govuk-frontend` for GOV.UK Design System styles.

`django-compressor` should work automatically to compile the govuk-frontend
SCSS on the first request and any subsequent request after the SCSS has
changed. In the meantime it will read from `frontend/CACHE`, which is
`.gitignore`d.

In production, we prepopulate `frontend/CACHE` using `manage.py compress`
which will mean that every request is served from the cache.

`django-compressor` also takes care of fingerprinting and setting cache headers
for our CSS.

#### Fonts and images

The govuk assets are versioned in the `npm` package. `make dev_environment`
includes a step to copy them to the `frontend` folder from where `runserver`
can serve them; you can rerun this with `make govuk_frontend`.

## Docs

We are using `adr-tools` to manage "Architectural Decision Records" - to track decisions made. To install and use: https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools.

## Support area

The support area is for admin use - adding users, running imports, giving users permissions to consultations etc.

Access the support area by going to `/support/`. You will need to be a "staff user" to access it.

If you are running locally, you can create a staff user by running `make dev_admin_user` - which creates an admin user (as described above).

On any environment, if you are a staff user, you can give other users permission to access the support area. Go to `/support/users/`.


## Importing data

### Data import format
Data should be stored in the appropriate S3 bucket (`AWS_DATA_BUCKET`) and within a folder called `app_data`.

It should be stored in the following structure for a given consultation:
```
<consultation-name>/
    ├── raw_data/
    │   └── ....
    ├── inputs/
    │   ├── question_part_<id>/
    │   │   ├── responses.jsonl
    │   │   └── question_part.json
    │   ├──  question_part_<id>/
    │   │   ├── responses.jsonl
    │   │   └── question_part.json
    │   ├── ...
    │   └── respondents.jsonl
    └── outputs/
        ├── mapping/
        │   ├── <timestamp>/
        │   │   ├── question_part_<id>/
        │   │   │   ├── meta.json
        │   │   │   ├── themes.json
        │   │   │   ├── sentiment.jsonl
        │   │   │   ├── detail_detection.jsonl
        │   │   │   └── mapping.jsonl
        │   │   ├── question_part_<id>/
        │   │   ├── ...
        │   ...  
        └── sign_off/
```

Note that we have the notion of "question part" to reflect the sub-questions within a question.

The format for each of these files is in `consultation_analyser/consultations/import_schema`. Some of the files are JSONL files - [JSONLines](https://jsonlines.org/). The schema are given in [JSON Schema format](https://json-schema.org/). In Python you can use the `jsonschema` library to validate a JSON instance.

Format of each of the files:
* `respondents.jsonl` - this is a JSONL file per consultation, where each entry is the format given in the `respondent.json` schema.
* `responses.jsonl` - this is a JSONL file per question part, where each entry is in the format given in the `response.json` schema.
* `question_part.json` - this is a JSON file per question part, and this must satisfy the format given in the `question_part.json` schema.
* `meta.json` - this is a file with metadata allowing us to match up inputs and outputs
* `themes.json` - this gives the themes for a given question part and run of ThemeFinder, with `theme_key` as a unique identifier for a theme (for a given question part). This is the format given by the `themes.json` schema.
* `sentiment.jsonl` - this a JSONL file per question part and run of themefinder, each row is a line in the format of `sentiment.json` with one row per response.
* `detail_detection.jsonl` - this a JSONL file per question part and run of themefinder, each row is a line in the format of `detail_detection.json` with one row per response.
* `mapping.jsonl` - this is a JSONL file per question part and run of themefinder, each row is a line in the format of `mapping.json`. Each row maps a given response to its themes.


### Data import process

You must be a staff user to import consultation data. The consultation data consists of input data on questions, responses, and respondent data, and output data which is further data on themes from themefinder.

Data should be stored in a specific structure in S3 (bucket specified by `AWS_BUCKET_NAME`) as described above.

**Run this locally first to ensure the data is valid before running in production.**

The import should be run in stages, which can be navigated to from `support/consultations/import-summary/`:

1. Create a consultation and import data on respondents `support/consultations/import-consultation`.
2. The import is running asynchronously - you can check its progress by looking at the queue in `support/django-rq/`.

If the import fails half-way, delete the consultation or question (which will delete all related objects) and re-import. This can be done by navigating to the individual consultation from `/support/consultations/`.

To run locally you must have access to your AWS account
