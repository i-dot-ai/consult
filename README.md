# Consultation analyser

The Consultation analyser is a machine learning and LLM-powered tool to automate the processing of public consultations.

## Setting up the application

### External dependencies

- PostgreSQL (`brew install postgresql`)
- GraphViz (`brew install graphviz`), for generating diagrams

### Environment variables

Populate `.env` by copying `.env.example` and filling in required values.

### Python

Ensure you have `python > 3.10` and `poetry` installed, then run `poetry install`.

### Database setup

```
make dev_environment
```

This will set up dev and test databases with dummy data. See the definition of that make task for the various steps.

You will have an staff user (i.e. one that can access the admin) created with the username `email@example.com` and the password `admin`.

Confirm everything is working with

```
make check_db
```

(You can see all the available `make` commands by running bare `make` or `make help`).

### Run the application

```
make serve
```

### Run the tests

```
make test
```

## The database

### Generating dummy data

Only run this in development. Will create a consultation with 10 complete
responses in a variety of question formats. This runs as part of `make
dev_environment`, but you can run it more than once.

```
make dummy_data
```

### Database migrations and schema diagram

If you use the `make migrate` command to run migrations, the diagram below will
be regenerated automatically. If you need to generate it outside that process,
you can run `manage.py generate_erd`. (You will need `graphviz` installed: see
[`pydot` docs](https://pypi.org/project/pydot/)).

### The frontend

#### CSS

We depend on `govuk-frontend` for GOV.UK Design System styles.

`django-compressor` should work automatically to compile the govuk-frontend
SCSS on the first request and any subsequent request after the SCSS has
changed. In the meantime it will read from `frontend/CACHE`, which is
`.gitignore`d.

In production, we prepopulate `frontend/CACHE` using `manage.py compress`
which will mean that every request is served from the cache.

`django-compressor` also takes care of fingerprinting and setting cache headers
for our CSS.

#### Fonts and images

The govuk assets are versioned in the `npm` package. `make dev_environment`
includes a step to copy them to the `frontend` folder from where `runserver`
can serve them; you can rerun this with `make govuk_frontend`.

## Schema documentation

The data schema for consultations supplied to the tool is defined in `consultation_analyser/consultations/public_schema/public_schema.yaml`.

To build the JSON schemas and examples from this file, run `make schema_docs`.

The `json-schema-faker-options.js` file configures (JSON Schema Faker)[https://github.com/json-schema-faker] to make the JSON examples.

## Frontend Prototype

Located at `/prototype` in this repo, using the GOV.UK Prototype Kit.

### How to run

Ensure you have a recent version of Node.js installed (v16 or greater). Then, **from the prototype directory**, run:

```
npm install
```

Then

```
npm run dev
```

The actual prototype can be accessed at http://localhost:3000/prototype
