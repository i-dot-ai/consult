      <h1 class="govuk-heading-l">Get involved</h1>
      <p>As the Consultation analyser is in the test and learn phase we need to learn how it compares to other methods you've used. How you can get involved depends on whether the consultation has already been analysed.</p>
      <p>If you would like to take part in one of the ways outlined below please <a href="https://www.smartsurvey.co.uk/s/consultation-interest/">register your interest</a>.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-body-l govuk-!-padding-top-5">You have recently <strong>completed</strong> a consultation</h2>
      <p>If you have recently completed an analysed a consultation the steps are:</p>
      <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
        <li>Agree <strong>data sharing</strong>. See draft <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uh4mVuQBEBfp_oSfzyIbsPzR3owS9PNK/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=103333141005222978195&rtpof=true&sd=true">Memorandum of Understanding</a>.</li>
        <li>We <strong>survey and interview</strong> the team involved in analysing the consultation.</li>
        <li>You get <strong>access to the Consultation analyser</strong> to share your data and see the themes it creates.</li>
        <li>We <strong>survey and interview</strong> those involved to understand your experience.</li>
        <li>We <strong>compare the themes</strong> generated by the original analysis and the Consultation analyser.</li>
        <li>Final <strong>debrief</strong> session to discuss the findings.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2 class="govuk-body-l govuk-!-padding-top-5">You have an <strong>upcoming</strong> consultation and you have other analysis already planned</h2>
      <p>If you have an upcoming consultation and you will be running the analysis in-house, and would like to use Consultation analyser alongside the steps are:</p>
      <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
        <li>Agree <strong>data sharing</strong>. See draft <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uh4mVuQBEBfp_oSfzyIbsPzR3owS9PNK/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=103333141005222978195&rtpof=true&sd=true">Memorandum of Understanding</a>.</li>
        <li>You <strong>conduct the analysis</strong> using the Consultation analyser and your normal process, including recording the amount of people and time involved. You may use a sample of the consultation responses or the full analysis.</li>
        <li>We <strong>survey and interview</strong> the team involved in analysing the consultation.</li>
        <li>We <strong>compare results</strong> in terms of the amount of people and time it takes to analyse the consultation responses using the different methods, as well as understanding your experience of the Consultations analyser in comparison to your normal process.</li>
        <li>Final <strong>debrief</strong> session to discuss the findings.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2 class="govuk-body-l govuk-!-padding-top-5">What we are hoping to learn</h2>
      <p>The objective of the research is to understand how the Consultation analyser works in practice and whether it will meet the needs of government departments conducting consultations. </p>
