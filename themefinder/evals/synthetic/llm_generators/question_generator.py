Consultation Principles and the Gunning Principles for fair public consultation.

## Question Types You Can Generate

1. **open_ended**: "What are your views on..." / "What measures should we consider..."
   - Used for gathering detailed qualitative feedback
   - Best for complex policy areas where diverse perspectives are needed

2. **agree_disagree**: Statement + 5-point Likert scale (Strongly Agree to Strongly Disagree)
   - Includes a `scale_statement` that respondents rate
   - Question asks "To what extent do you agree or disagree with the following statement:"
   - Always followed by "Please explain your reasoning"

3. **yes_no**: Binary question with "Please explain your answer"
   - Used for clear-cut policy decisions
   - Example: "Do you agree that [specific proposal] should be implemented?"

4. **multiple_choice**: "Which of the following... Please select all that apply"
   - Includes `multi_choice_options` array
   - Used when there are defined options to choose between

## UK Government Consultation Principles

- **Neutral framing**: Never use leading questions that suggest a preferred answer
- **Plain English**: Avoid jargon, acronyms, and complex policy language
- **One concept per question**: Don't combine multiple ideas
- **Formative stage**: Questions should gather input, not validate decisions already made
- **Balanced information**: Present different perspectives fairly

## Question Structure Patterns

1. Start with broader strategic questions
2. Progress to more specific/technical questions
3. Mix question types for variety
4. Each question should serve a clear purpose

## Common Phrasings

- "What are your views on..."
- "What measures should we consider to..."
- "To what extent do you agree or disagree that..."
- "Do you agree that [proposal] should..."
- "Which of the following [options] do you think..."
- "What would be the most appropriate way to..."
- "Are there other ways in which we can..."
- "What impact would [proposal] have on..."
