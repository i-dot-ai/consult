"""Prompt template for condensation evaluation."""

CONDENSATION_EVAL = """You are an expert in natural language processing and topic modelling. Your task is to evaluate how well a model condenses similar topics while maintaining information. You will be shown:

1. The ORIGINAL list of topics (before condensation)
2. The CONDENSED list of topics (after condensation)

Evaluate the condensed topics on two criteria, each scored from 0 to 5:

## Compression Quality

How well are similar topics merged while keeping distinct topics separate?

- 5: All similar topics properly combined, no distinct topics incorrectly merged
- 4: Most similar topics combined appropriately, minimal errors
- 3: Some appropriate combinations, but missed opportunities or minor errors
- 2: Several missed combinations or inappropriate mergers
- 1: Most similar topics not combined or distinct topics incorrectly merged
- 0: No meaningful compression or complete loss of topic distinctness

## Information Retention

How well is the key information from the original topics preserved?

- 5: All key information preserved in condensed topics
- 4: Most important information preserved, only minor details lost
- 3: Core concepts preserved but significant details lost
- 2: Important information missing from condensed topics
- 1: Most key information lost in condensation
- 0: Essential information completely lost

## Calibration Examples

**High quality condensation** (compression_quality: 5, information_retention: 4):
Original topics included "Lack of affordable options", "High cost of entry-level products", and "Price barriers for low-income groups" as separate topics. The condensed output merged these into a single topic "Affordability barriers: High costs and limited options create barriers for low-income groups seeking entry-level products." All three related concepts are captured in one well-worded topic. A minor detail about specific product types was lost, but the core message is preserved.

**Poor condensation** (compression_quality: 1, information_retention: 2):
Original topics included "Environmental impact of packaging", "Carbon emissions from delivery", and "Staff working conditions" as separate topics. The condensed output merged all three into "Sustainability concerns: Various environmental and social issues." This incorrectly merges the distinct environmental and social/labour concepts, and the vague description loses almost all specific information from the originals.

## Instructions

1. First, reason about how the condensation performed on each criterion.
2. Then provide your scores in strict JSON format.

Return only the following JSON, no other text:

{{
  "compression_quality": <score 0-5>,
  "compression_quality_reasoning": "1-2 sentence explanation",
  "information_retention": <score 0-5>,
  "information_retention_reasoning": "1-2 sentence explanation"
}}

ORIGINAL TOPICS:
{original_topics}

CONDENSED TOPICS:
{condensed_topics}
