    <p class="govuk-body">As Consult is in the test and learn phase we need to learn how it compares to other methods you've used. How you can get involved depends on whether the consultation has already been analysed.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">If you would like to take part in one of the ways outlined below please contact us at <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:i-dot-ai-enquiries@cabinetoffice.gov.uk">i-dot-ai-enquiries@cabinetoffice.gov.uk</a>.</p>

      <li>We <strong>survey and interview</strong> the team involved in analysing the consultation.</li>
      <li>You get <strong>access to Consult</strong> to share your data and see the themes it creates.</li>
      <li>We <strong>survey and interview</strong> those involved to understand your experience.</li>
      <li>We <strong>compare the themes</strong> generated by the original analysis and Consult.</li>

    </ol>

    <h2 class="govuk-body-l govuk-!-padding-top-5">You have an <strong>upcoming</strong> consultation and you have other analysis already planned</h2>

      <li>You <strong>conduct the analysis</strong> using Consult and your normal process, including recording the amount of people and time involved. You may use a sample of the consultation responses or the full analysis.</li>
      <li>We <strong>survey and interview</strong> the team involved in analysing the consultation.</li>
